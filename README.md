# Miorga Fight
 
Miorga is the world's first and best side-on action fighting game designed by British geniuses Ed and Finlay. Your character has a number of guards from which they may perform two actions, excluding walking about. Some actions have additional options, such as feinting an attack or performing an additional action after your first. In 2021 Miorga won the Booker prize for fiction and director Stanley Kubrick described it as 'a better film than 2001'

## Playing

### Android:
 - Download the latest .apk from releases:
   - You will first have to allow installs from Unknown sources
   - Your phone will constantly complain about how this isn't safe and you shouldn't install it this way so only do it if you're really dangerous and enjoy living life on the edge
   - Sorry, but I'm not paying to whack it on the playstore for no one to download it
 - If you don't trust us you can build it yourself, it's not to complex
