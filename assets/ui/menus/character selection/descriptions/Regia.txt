Regia - Lord Regia Heloine - is a monster hunter of austere nature and uncontested pride. The second son of the high lord of Orvia, he devoted himself not to aristocracy but to that of the monster hunting nomad. His discipline has caused him to develop keen precision in his blows. This may cost him some speed but he nevertheless deals a lot of damage.
