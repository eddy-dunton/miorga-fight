A monolithic structure birthed of the ocean, Market Harbour was once a castle of purely military utility. Now it hosts a bold array of merchants and sailors at the very heart of the Crackedlands. Its jagged and inimcal rocks form wicked ridges and great bluffs yet fail to disuade the cascades traffic, and it serves as a huge mixing pot of the many cultures of the isles surrounding it.
